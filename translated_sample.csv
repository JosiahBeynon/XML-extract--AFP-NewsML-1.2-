Dogs have their restaurant in Rome.,Italy-animals-food-restaurant-world service,"Arabic, journal, from the world.",Guildas Law Ro,"The ""Fido"" restaurant in Rome has a unique atmosphere, with soft lighting, quiet music, and a staff ready to serve any customer. While the place may resemble other restaurants, it stands out by providing dogs with the same level of attention as their owners.

The menu designed for these animals offers a variety of options, including fish with ricotta and zucchini, minced chicken and mashed vegetables, and a bowl of greens. Among the beverages served are green apple juice and watermelon juice.

In an interview with Agence France-Presse, Luca Grammatico, a dog trainer and the head chef at the restaurant, which opened a month ago, said that the food menu was studied by a specialist in animal nutrition to determine the ingredients to use, taking into account the allergies dogs may have. He added that dogs have much more sensitivity than humans.

Dogs seem to be happy in this environment, as there is no barking heard, and the animals focus on their dishes while sitting in comfortable dedicated boxes. ""Bibi,"" a four-year-old Bichon dog with black and white fur, licks the bowl until there is no trace of food left.

Sara Nicosanti, a 36-year-old real estate worker who takes a selfie with her five-year-old Jack Russell dog, ""Mango,"" in the restaurant with mirrored walls, sees pets as ""part of our family, so why not treat them as a family member?""

She expresses great happiness with the wide variety of options provided by the menu and says, ""Dogs can have a balanced diet.""

The bearded chef with sparkling eyes points out that the dishes are prepared ""without spices, salt, or oils,"" and he strives to present the plates in an appetizing manner, adding white creamy sauces and shaping the food in various forms, such as bone-shaped plates.

Luca highlights that fish is a favorite dish for dogs because its flavor is different from their usual food, which surprises many.

On that night, Romina Lanza, a 40-year-old lawyer, visited the restaurant to celebrate her dog Rodi's fourth birthday. She believes that ""Fido"" represents a ""welcoming initiative."" Even though hunger is threatening some people, she defends what she described as a ""personal choice,"" saying, ""I don't see anything wrong with this step.""

Maria Gliotunna, a twenty-year-old student who learned about the restaurant through TikTok and attended with her two-year-old ""Nala"" and four-month-old ""Douglas,"" agrees with her. She says, ""Only those who don't have dogs would not think that way.""

The idea of establishing this restaurant in the trendy Ponte Milvio neighborhood, which is full of bars and restaurants frequented by wealthy people, came by chance to three modern young men.

Marco Turano (33 years old), one of the restaurant's founders, says, ""Honestly, we did not expect such prosperity, and we are very happy. What matters most is that we feel joy because we provide this experience for dogs.""

Since its opening, the restaurant has hosted an average of six to ten dogs each evening during the week and ten to fifteen dogs on weekends. The cost for each dog ranges from eight to twenty euros, depending on the size of the animal.

Every detail in the restaurant's design has been carefully studied. Marco says, ""We placed dividers between the tables, so each dog can maintain its privacy while eating and not disturb any other animal.""

In addition to their surprise gift, Rodi will also receive a birthday cake consisting of ""cheese biscuits decorated with ricotta and green apple flavor.""

Professional League: Irving against the restart plan in Orlando,Basketball-NBA-health-virus,"Arabic, journal, sport",Mike Stuby,"Multiple news reports on Saturday confirmed that Kyrie Irving, the star player of the Brooklyn Nets, participated in a conference call with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and expressed his opposition to resuming the season on July 31st in Orlando, Florida.

According to ESPN and The Athletic, citing unnamed sources, the meeting, which included around 100 players on Friday, addressed issues of racial discrimination and current politics.

Other players also expressed concerns about the issues related to Orlando's plan to resume competitions and the safety measures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the season being suspended in March.

Irving, as reported by The Athletic, said: ""I don't support going to Orlando. I feel something is a little fishy.""

Cameroonian player Joel Embiid, Carmelo Anthony, Donovan Mitchell, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, and Dwight Howard were among the players whose names were mentioned as participants in the call.

Irving will not be able to participate in the competitions due to undergoing shoulder surgery three months ago.

The reports indicated that the players agreed that they need to stand united in the face of any decision, especially due to concerns about the economic impact on players.

The reports also stated that agents warned their clients that they could lose $1.2 billion in salaries if the season is not completed, and they urged the league to withdraw from the collective bargaining agreement with the union, potentially leading to worse salary conditions in future seasons, with the possibility of the pandemic reducing the previously expected revenue levels.

"Virtual character through the game ""Fortnite"" to rescue children who are victims of abuse.",France - Children - Exploitation - Games - Dunia Service,"Arabic, journal, from the world.",Arno buffet,"Through a virtual character wearing blue wings, I entered the famous online game ""Fortnite"", allowing over 350 children and teenagers who have experienced abuse or have problems to confide in real adults during the isolation period in France.

The French association ""L'Enfant Bleu"" (The Blue Child), dedicated to protecting children, supervised this unprecedented experiment, which remained confidential until now, hoping to pave the way for a permanent mechanism to help at-risk children through online games.

Laura Moran, the director of the association, considered this first-of-its-kind initiative in France and abroad aimed to overcome the biggest challenge faced by child protection workers, which is ""allowing the child to speak and the adult to detect the presence of a problem.""

Moran emphasized, ""But youth do not use the same means of communication as adults. We have to adapt and find new ways to communicate with them.""

To achieve this, association volunteers entered the virtual world of Fortnite with the character named ""The Sleepless Child"" and took turns to play as the character, available every day until 10:30 PM. This virtual character's mission was to respond to young players who wanted to talk about their personal problems while playing the game.

Within a month, 1200 children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 17 engaged with the virtual character, which is a ""remarkable"" number, according to Laura Moran. In most cases, young players pressed the button out of curiosity, but 30% revealed personal problems of varying severity, with some indicating that they were in very dangerous situations. The association was able to direct them to specialized organizations that combat bullying and harassment.

To ensure the success of the experiment, young players needed to be informed about the available assistance without the knowledge of parents who might be the source of abuse. Therefore, the project organizers refrained from promoting their project through mainstream media and instead collaborated with well-known influencers in the gaming community.

Fabrice Blazuel, from the agency ""Avaas Sports and Entertainment,"" which oversaw the project, stated that this was the appropriate channel to reach children who need help without attracting the attention of the abusers.

Through partnerships with professional esports teams or influencers with millions of subscribers, they broadcast messages explaining the mechanism and how to contact the virtual character via Snapchat, Instagram, and the Twitch platform, which live broadcasts video games. These platforms are less likely to be accessed by parents. Blazuel said, ""Since the children were confined without any other means of reporting, it would have been tragic if a parent noticed the mechanism and stopped the gaming platform.""

The messages stated, ""If you are a victim of any form of violence, add the account 'Enfant Bleu' on Fortnite.""

This process affirmed that online games provide an encouraging approach to facilitate communication for children who are victims of abuse, according to Moran. However, she emphasized the need to go further and consider the long-term adoption of this approach.

For this purpose, a working group will be formed in September, consisting of video game designers, judges, specialized police units, and child protection authorities, in addition to the association, with the goal of ""providing an additional tool in the range of options available for the child to seek help, based on their own perspectives.""","Paris, FRA"

Spanish Championship: Barcelona starts its comeback to competitions with a big win over Mallorca 4-0.,Spain hosted the championship.,"العربية، مجلة، رياضة

Arabic, journal, sport",Khaimi Rina,"Barcelona, ​​the leader and defending champion, made a triumphant return to competition with a crushing 4-0 win over Mallorca on Saturday in the 28th round of the Spanish football league, the first after the resumption of competition on Thursday after a three-month hiatus due to the coronavirus.

The Chilean Arturo Vidal (2), the Danish Martin Braithwaite (37), Jordi Alba (79), and the Argentine Lionel Messi (90+3) scored goals for Barcelona, ​​which strengthened its position at the top with 61 points, temporarily five points ahead of its direct pursuer Real Madrid, which will host Eibar on Sunday to conclude the round.

Barcelona dominated the first half by scoring two goals from only two opportunities, before delivering the knockout blow to the hosts in the second half with two more goals, including Messi's goal, the star of the match, and the provider of Braithwaite and Alba's goals.

Captain Messi played from the start after suffering a muscle injury last midweek, while Uruguayan international Luis Suarez, who recovered from surgery he underwent in January on his right knee meniscus, sat on the bench before being brought on by coach Quique Setién in the 57th minute, replacing the Frenchman Antoine Griezmann, who has been underperforming lately.

Vidal gave Barcelona the lead in the second minute with a close-range header from a cross from Alba, bringing his tally to seven goals this season.

Japanese Takafusa Kubo, on loan from Real Madrid, almost equalized with a direct free kick from outside the box that bounced off German goalkeeper Ter Stegen before being cleared by the defense (32).

Braithwaite extended Barcelona's lead when he received a header from Messi inside the box and fired a powerful shot with his right foot into the net (37).

This is Braithwaite's first goal in Barcelona colors since joining the club in February last year from Leganes as a medical joker (under a clause in the tournament's rules that allows the team to do so for compelling medical reasons), outside the transfer market after the season-ending injury to its French star Ousmane Dembele.

Braithwaite became the third Danish player to score for Barcelona after Michael Laudrup (39 goals) and Allan Simonsen (31).

Croatian Ante Budimir came close to reducing the deficit with a header from inside the box that went just next to the right post (45+1), and he himself fired a powerful shot from outside the box that went just next to Ter Stegen's right post (48).

Alba delivered the final blow to Mallorca by scoring the third goal when he received a pass from Messi, penetrated the box, and shot with his left foot to the right of goalkeeper Manolo (79).

Messi wrapped up the party in the third minute of injury time when he received a pass from Suarez inside the box, dribbled past defenders, and shot forcefully with his right foot into the net.

It was Messi's 20th goal of the season, consolidating his position at the top of the goalscorers list.

The Asian Games ignite the Olympic dream for esports.,Masters-Computer-2023-2022-Indonesia-Games,"Arabic, journal, sport",Faisal Kamal and Songhee Huang,"The inclusion of esports as an official competition for the first time in the Asian Games this month marks the first steps towards its recognition and adoption in the Olympic Games. Esports was first included in the Asian Games in 2018 as a demonstration event, but in the current edition in Hangzhou, China, the winners will receive medals, in addition to regional glory in seven different games (EA SPORTS FC, PUBG Mobile, Arena of Valor, Dota 2, League of Legends, Dream Three Kingdoms 2, and Street Fighter V).

Mayank Prakash, India's hopeful for a medal in Street Fighter, believes that the Asian Games, which start on September 23rd and run until October 8th, will determine the progress of esports.

He remembers how his father used to punish him for sneaking out of the house to play video games. He said, ""I played for the first time in the late 90s on a machine in one of the markets with the 20 rupees I had."" He continued, ""That was my first experience with Street Fighter, and I fell in love with it. I became addicted to it, and I often lied to my parents and told them I was going to study, but I spent hours playing.""

Prakash, a 33-year-old 3D designer, remembers how his father once tracked him down at night and discovered him playing video games, surrounded by six children full of joy. He laughed and said, ""I got scolded... I think I got hit.""

Prakash's story seems familiar to many.

On the other hand, Kim Gwan-woo, a 41-year-old representing South Korea in Street Fighter V, said that his parents hate it when he plays video games, emphasizing that they are still ""hesitant"" about his participation in the Asian Games. He added, ""I think they will be very happy if I actually win a medal.""

South Korea, along with host country China, are expected to be the dominant forces in esports competitions during the current Asian Games edition.

- Olympic Dream? -

The esports events at the Games are expected to attract large crowds at the state-of-the-art Hangzhou Esports Sports Center, which is far removed from the makeshift places in dirty corridors where players used to sneak in against their parents' wishes.

Professor Kang of Shingu College, who was one of the first-generation professional players under the alias ""H.O.T Forever,"" told AFP, ""Its inclusion in the Asian Games is a landmark for esports in its quest for recognition as a 'real' sport.""

He continued, ""When I was a player in the late 90s, the initial reaction was, why are video games being broadcast on television?""

""But with the hard work of the players and the coaching staff, I think we have reached nearly 90 percent of becoming a real sport.""

On the other hand, Lukesh Suji, Vice President of the Asian Esports Federation, described the Asian Games as a milestone towards a greater goal. Suji, who is also the director of the Esports Federation of India, said, ""The dream will eventually come true once it is included in the Olympics, as it is a sport where winners can earn medals.""

Despite these significant steps, the Olympic dream seems far from reality at the moment, definitely not before the 2024 Paris Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is keen on attracting a younger audience, which is why breakdancing has been included for the first time in Paris. However, while the IOC officially recognized esports as a sport in 2017, there is currently no plan to include it in the Olympic program. One of the obstacles is the types of games to be included, as promoting violence goes against Olympic values, which would immediately exclude some of the most popular esports games.

- Stealth! -

Although the Olympic dream remains distant for now, practitioners of these games affirm that the inclusion of esports in the Asian Games has already led to a radical change in attitudes. They hope that the success of esports during the upcoming Games in Hangzhou will attract more fans, players, and appreciation.

Sanyandya Malik (21), who participates in the Indian team in the game League of Legends, used to pretend to study on his computer while secretly playing online games. He said, ""Sometimes during the tournament, I had to hide from my parents so they wouldn't know what was going on and I could play.""

He continued, ""But after choosing to represent India, my parents noticed the appreciation that this game could bring me.""

He concluded, saying, ""Even family and friends who previously doubted the time I spent playing have congratulated me, and that feels good.""
